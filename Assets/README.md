I can make Playmaker actions or Behavior Designer tasks-

Tell me what you intend to use it for and let me know what should go IN to the action/task and what should come OUT
  -Example = Input is two GameObjects and Output is the distance between them as a float variable
  
I'll work on these when I have free time- thanks.
